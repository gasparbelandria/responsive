// CSS-only tabs made easy with Sass.

// This demonstrates how I use the float isolation method, along with opacity and z-index, to create a responsive tab container. 

// - Container wraps all tabs dynamically
// - Container size remains equal across tabs
// - No JS height calculations
// - The entire thing is responsive

// You can use the `display` property instead if you want the container to change sizes depending on its content.
